        "The Prisoner’s Dilemma is a foundational problem in game theory that demonstrates a conflict between **individual rationality** and **collective welfare**.\n",
        "\n",
        "It describes a scenario where two players must make a decision independently, and although mutual cooperation gives the best total payoff, each player has an incentive to defect. This leads to an outcome where both players act rationally but end up worse off.\n",

        "- conflicts of interest  \n",
        "- cooperation vs competition  \n",
        "- rational behaviour in uncertain environments  \n",
        "\n",
        "The **Quantum Prisoner’s Dilemma (QPD)** extends this classical setup into the quantum domain, where players can use quantum strategies such as:\n",
